# AutoComply

**Automated Configuration Drift & Cybersecurity Compliance Checker**

AutoComply is a lightweight, CLI-based tool designed to scan system or application environment configurations against major cybersecurity compliance standards like **NIST**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI-DSS**. It detects configuration drift, flags non-compliant settings, and generates a Markdown report with a compliance score and severity levels.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Supports multiple compliance standards (NIST, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- 📊 Generates detailed Markdown reports with:
  - PASS/FAIL status
  - Compliance Score (in %)
  - Severity levels: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- 🔁 Easy to extend with new rules and standards
- 📁 JSON-based rule definitions

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. You provide a system/environment configuration as a JSON file.
2. Select a compliance standard (NIST, HIPAA, PCI).
3. AutoComply compares your config against that standard’s baseline.
4. Generates a `report.md` with results, score, and severity levels.

## 🧪 Example Usage

Run the tool:

```bash
python scanner.py
````

Select a compliance standard when prompted:

```
Choose a compliance standard:
- nist
- hipaa
- pci
Standard: hipaa
```

View the output in your terminal and in `report.md`.

## 📄 Sample Baseline Rule

```json
"USE_SSL": {
  "expected": "True",
  "severity": "HIGH"
}
```

---

## ✅ Example Config (`scans/sample_env_config.json`)

```json
{
  "USE_SSL": "False",
  "ENCRYPTED_STORAGE": "True",
  "SESSION_TIMEOUT": "5",
  "AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED": "False"
}
```


## 💡 Extend It

To add your own standard or modify rules, edit files inside the `baselines/` folder. Each rule must include:

* `expected`: expected value
* `severity`: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
